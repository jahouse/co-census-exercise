# About
### Take-home exercise as part of co:census's interview process. Was tasked with using the Yelp Fusion API to select certain restaurants based in a city of my choice and using ESRI tools to create visualizations. Used python to pull and clean API data in getData.py. Used ESRI's ArcGIS Online tools to create map layer of restaurant locations and dashboard describing features of the data.
